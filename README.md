# Molecular Dynamics Study on the Shock Induced Spallation of Polyethylene 

This repository contains the MD (LAMMPS) models and the DFT (VASP) model used in our recent paper (shown below). The required LAMMPS files to run MD simulations of shock propagation and spallation of polyethylene is also available.
