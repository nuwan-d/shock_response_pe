# Molecular Dynamics Study on the Shock Induced Spallation of Polyethylene 

This repository contains the MD (LAMMPS) models and the DFT (VASP) model (shown below), which we used in this publication. The required LAMMPS files to run MD simulations of shock propagation and spallation of polyethylene is also available.
